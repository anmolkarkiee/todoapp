* Delete completed tasks
  When you have completed a task on your to-do list, you can mark it as done by clicking on the “Done” button. 
  This will automatically remove the task from your list and mark it as completed. This feature helps you keep 
  your to-do list up-to-date and decluttered, allowing you to focus on the tasks that still need to be done.

* Update existing tasks
  Clicking on a task in your to-do list opens a new activity or window where you can view and edit the details of the task. 
  This includes fields for the title, description, due date, and priority level, all of which will be pre-populated with

  updated accordingly. This feature allows you to make changes to your tasks as needed and keep your to-do list up-to-date.

* Set task priority 
  When adding or editing a task, you can select its priority level using radio buttons for “High,” “Medium,” and “Low.” 
  If you don’t select a priority level, the task will automatically be assigned a “Low” priority. This feature allows you

  installation of apps from unknown sources on your Android device. This can usually be done in the security settings of

  been verified for safety and security. It’s always a good idea to research the app and its developer before installing it 
  on your device
